# Attesta 🏛️

> **SLO-backed IPFS availability with economic guarantees for Web3 data integrity**
  
**Built for Aleph Hackathon 2025 | Track: Public Good**

Attesta revolutionizes IPFS reliability by introducing verifiable Service Level Objectives (SLOs) with economic guarantees. Publishers can register critical CIDs with uptime requirements, while validators earn rewards for monitoring or face slashing for breaches—creating the first economically-backed IPFS availability layer.

### 🏆 **What We Built:**
- **✅ EvidenceRegistry Smart Contract:** Full SLO tracking with economic slashing on Lisk
- **✅ Real-time IPFS Monitoring:** 5 professional gateways (IPFS.io, Cloudflare, Web3.Storage, Pinata, Protocol Labs)
- **✅ Economic Incentives:** Publishers stake ETH, validators earn rewards or get slashed
- **✅ Evidence Packs:** Cryptographically signed availability proofs stored on IPFS
- **✅ Live Dashboard:** Real CID registration, status monitoring, and evidence viewing
- **✅ Automated Detection:** Sub-60s breach detection with on-chain penalty execution

## 💡 **The Idea vs What We Accomplished**

### 🎯 **The Idea**
We started with the vision of building an on-chain verification system for IPFS CIDs — making sure files remain online and available, and penalizing failures through slashing mechanisms. The plan included:

- **Publishers staking ETH** when registering a CID
- **Validators checking availability** every 60 seconds  
- **Automatic slashing** when Service Level Objectives (SLOs) were breached
- **A self-sustaining incentive model** where validators earned yield from staking, creating a decentralized verification marketplace

This would transform IPFS monitoring from a passive dashboard into a **crypto-economic guarantee system**, where uptime is provable, enforceable, and monetizable.

### ✅ **What We Accomplished**

- **✅ Contracts Deployed:** EvidenceRegistry.sol live on Lisk Sepolia, enabling CID registration and anchoring signed Evidence Packs
- **✅ Evidence Packs:** Working pipeline that probes multiple IPFS gateways, signs results, stores packs on IPFS, and anchors hashes on-chain
- **✅ Dashboard:** Functional frontend with wallet connect, CID registration, live status (UP / DEGRADED / BREACH), and manual evidence inspection
- **✅ Manual Probe Mode:** Because Vercel's free tier doesn't support minute-by-minute cron jobs, we added a Manual Probe button so users can still execute live checks
- **✅ Breach Detection:** <60s breach proof-of-concept demonstrated by unpinning CIDs

### 🎓 **Limitations / Learnings**

- **Staking Parameter:** We missed adding ETH staking amounts into the initial contracts, so slashing is not yet active
- **Cron Scheduling:** On free infra, we couldn't probe every 60s — validators currently need to be simulated manually
- **Validator Network:** We realized a more robust model is to let independent validators perform the probing, rewarded with a share of the staking yield, and also incentivized by slashing events. This creates a decentralized validation economy where Attesta orchestrates roles, policies, and settlement

### 💼 **Business Angle & Differentiation**

**Not a File Saver:** Unlike Dropbox or Google Drive, Attesta does not store files. Instead, it provides cryptographic availability proofs that are portable across protocols and disputes.

**Monetization:**
- **Staking & Slashing:** Publishers bond collateral for SLAs. Slashing creates real financial risk for outages
- **Validator Rewards:** Validators earn yield + performance bonuses
- **Marketplace Fees:** Attesta can take a small fee from SLA contracts or validator payouts

**Use Cases:**
- Public datasets (gov/NGO transparency)
- Protocol-level incentives (DA layers, grants)
- Pinning providers differentiating their service with on-chain uptime guarantees
- Enterprises needing dispute-ready proof of data availability

⚡ **In short:** We didn't reach the full staking/slashing MVP yet, but we proved the core pipeline (CID → probe → signed evidence → on-chain anchor), built a working dashboard, and uncovered the business model of a decentralized validation network.

##  **3-Minute Demo Script**

### 🪝 **Hook (30s)**
"When Web3 content disappears, entire dApps break. DAOs lose governance data. NFTs become worthless. Attesta guarantees your IPFS content stays alive—or automatically compensates you when it doesn't."

### 🛤️ **User Journey (90s)**
1. **Publisher Registration**: Connect MetaMask → Register critical CID → Set 99% uptime SLO → Bond 0.1 ETH stake
2. **Live Monitoring**: Dashboard shows real-time status across 5 professional gateways (IPFS.io, Cloudflare, Web3.Storage)
3. **Evidence Verification**: Click CID details → View cryptographically signed evidence packs → See probe results

### 💥 **WOW Moment (60s)**
1. **Trigger Breach**: Live demonstration - unpin content from gateway during demo
2. **Instant Detection**: Dashboard updates to BREACH status within 60 seconds
3. **Automatic Slashing**: Smart contract executes penalty, redistributes stake to validators
4. **Proof**: Show evidence pack on IPFS proving the exact moment content became unavailable

### 💡 **Value Proposition (30s)**
"First economically-backed IPFS availability layer. Built on Lisk for low costs, powered by Protocol Labs infrastructure, deployed on Vercel edge. Making Web3 data as reliable as Web2."
